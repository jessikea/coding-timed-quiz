# coding-timed-quiz

This project involved making a timed quiz with questions based on coding. There are 5 total questions with four choice answers. For every incorrect answer, time (initial time is 75) is reduced by 10. All answers must be answered otherwise the score will be 0 at the end of timer. Final score is determined by how much time is left by the end of the quiz. Highscores are stored into local storage and displayed on highscore page.
